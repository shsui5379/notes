- Implicit data structures
	- The structure wasn't intentionally made, but by tracing through the algorithm, it implicity exists
	- Ex: when transitioning though the possible states in a state-space search, a bidirectional graph was effectively traced out
- Explicit data structures
	- The structure was intentionally constructed
	- Static: memory footprint set at compile time.  Ex: array
	- Dynamic: memory footprint adjustable at runtime.  Ex: list
- Data structures are structures of storing data.  The structure is maintained by rules/restrictions, but these rules are there to make the soup of data more usable (ex: easier to insert, delete, lookup, etc.).  Different data structures have different trade-offs, so it's important to evaluate the context in which it'll be used, to determine which trade-offs make sense
