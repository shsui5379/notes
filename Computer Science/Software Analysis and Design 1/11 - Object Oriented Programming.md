# Encapsulation
- To group all related things into one abstract unit (a class)
- Making states private, for their protection
- However, strictly sticking to OOP Encapsulation policy causes awkward fracturing of things, and creation of "fake" data types
  - For things that are purely logical, functional programming would be better.  Takes an input, perform an action, return an output
