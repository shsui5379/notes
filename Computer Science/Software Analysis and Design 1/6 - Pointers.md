- Pointers store a memory address
- To declare a pointer, the data type would be `type*`
  - `double*` would be the type for a pointer to a double variable in memory
- To get the address of an existing variable, add `&` in front of the variable name
- To resolve the value that a pointer is pointing to, add `*` in front of the pointer's name
- Dangling pointers: if a pointer is currently not being used to point to data that you know is valid, make it point to `nullptr` instead
- To access the members of a pointer to an object or struct, use `->` instead of `.`
- An array's name is a pointer to the first element of the array
