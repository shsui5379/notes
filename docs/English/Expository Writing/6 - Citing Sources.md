- MLA parenthetical citation: (author last name, page number if applicable), before the period
- Introduce the citation before including it, and don't make it read abrupt
- Guide the reader through what you want them to do with that information before moving on
- Have a works cited page
- Be careful about conflating your ideas from the ideas you're citing
