# Social Interactions
- The world as a stage
  - Use of impression management to maintain:
  - Roles
  - Status, social position
- Audience segregation
  - Front stage: where the performance happens.  High stakes
  - Back stage: our retreat.  Where we can truly be ourselves.
  - Audience is segregated to avoid role conflict
- Civil inattention
  - Acknowledge another's presence without engaging with them
  - Those that disrupt this disrupts social order
- Face, gestures, emotions
  - Nonverbal communication
  - Body gestures, postures aren't culturally innate
    - The smile is universal for happy, but culture only affects the width and duration of the smile
  - Some facial expressions are used to convey information instead of emotions
  - Paul Ekman's Facial Action Coding System
- Unfocused Interactions
  - Engaging in civil inattention
- Focused Interactions
  - expressions
  - What the person gives: words and expressions the person used in a performance
  - What the person gives off: clues that the audience perceives from the performance.  Used to examine the person for sincerity
- Response cries
  - Verbal utterances (uh, oops) that indicate that a mistake was minor, and that the person still has control over their performance
  - Performance mode: monitoring and censoring performance
- Social interactions are in terms of space and time

# Theories

  - Line: verbal and nonverbal patterns that one expresses in an interaction.  Once established, it is stuck, and changing it can lead to a loss of credibility
  - Face: the values one takes on based on the line the person thinks they have
  - Maintaining face: aligning self to line
    - failure to maintain face causes discredibility, awkwardness, embarrassment, loss of confidence.  Stakes are high around people you see regularly
  - Poise: ability to recover from getting loss of face
  - To save face: to help someone recover from being loss of face
  - Shameless: a person who intentionally makes someone lose face
  - Defend your own face.  Protect others' face.  Avoid interactions where a face can be threatened.
