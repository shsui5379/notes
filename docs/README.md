- Math equations are KaTeX based. Can be rendered in places like VSCode's Markdown preview
- The only pull requests that will be accepted are those that correct mistakes, make additions/modifications for clarity purpose, or similar
- If the GitHub Pages site is too buggy, then just stick with the built-in Markdown renderer in GitHub itself
