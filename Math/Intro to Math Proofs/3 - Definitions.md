- If $n$ is an even integer, $\exists k \in Z, 2k = n$
- If $n$ is an odd integer, $\exists k \in Z, 2k + 1 = n$
- Suppose $a, b \in Z$.  If $a|b$, then $\exists k \in Z, k = b/a$
  - $|$ meaning divides
- $p$ is prime iff $p$ has only 2 positive factors
- Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every polynomial with degree $n > 0$ has exactly $n$ roots
- Suppose $a, b \in Z$, and $n \in N$.  $(a \equiv b (mod \> n)) \implies (n | (a - b)).$
  - a and b are congruent if they have the same remainder when divided by n
  - $\equiv$ means congruent
  - $mod$ means modulo (get the remainder after dividing)
- If $n$ is rational, then $\exists p, q \in Z, q \not ={0}, p/q = n$, where p/q is in lowest terms
- Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetics: all numbers are a product of primes


# Classical proofs
- Proving $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
  - Assume that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational
  - By definition of rational, $\exists p, q \in Z, q \not = 0, p/q = \sqrt{2}$, where p/q is in lowest terms
  - $\sqrt{2} = p/q$
  - $2 = p^2 / q^2$
  - $2q^2 = p^2$
  - $p^2$ must be even
  - $p$ must be even
  - By definition of even, $\exists k \in Z, p = 2k$
  - $2q^2 = 4p^2$
  - $q^2 = 2p^2$
  - $q^2$ must be even
  - $q$ must be even
  - Both p and q are even, so p/q could not be in lowest terms, so $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be rational
- Proving there are infinite number of prime numbers
  - Assume there are a finite number of prime numbers: $p_1, p_2, p_3, ... , p_n$
  - $(p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}...p_{n}+1) \% p_{any} = 1$ 
  - This means no prime numbers go into $p_{1}p_{2}p_{3}...p_{n}+1$, which means that it is prime itself, but that number isn't in our defined list of prime numbers, so there must be infinite primes
