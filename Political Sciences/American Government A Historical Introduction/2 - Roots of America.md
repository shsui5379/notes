# Development

- French and Indian War: British won the war.  War is costly, and the British heavily taxed the colonists to recover the cost.  The colonists weren't represented in Parliament, and weren't happy about that.  "No taxation without representation"
- Enlightenment Ideas
	- Magma Carta: Protection of life, liberty, property
	- John Locke: social contract: people give up some freedom in order to be protected by the government.  If the government doesn't respect the people, the people have the right to change or overturn it.
- Mayflower Compact: male colonists can vote on the colony's laws.  They wanted to replace the monarch with another government
- Boston Massacre: British opened fire on the colonists.  Soldiers went to court and got acquitted for self-defense.  The colonists are angry.
- Tea Act: British raised the import tea price.  Colonists dressed up as Natives, and threw tea into the water.
- Declaration of Independence: list of grievances against the British.  Not a legal document

# Articles of Confederation

- After separating from Britain, a new government was formed
- Different colonies didn't really trust each other, so the confederation was a "friendship" between independent sovereign states forming a union
- Flaws
	- unanimous consent required for amendments
		- which basically means amendments will be impossible
	- national government has no power to taxation
		- one consequence was inability to pay for the war
		- also, they couldn't form an army, and the British still didn't vacate North America
	- no interstate regulation
	- no judicial system
	- no executive power / no leader
	- one state one vote, while some states are much larger than others
- Shay's Rebellion
	- Since the government couldn't collect tax, it couldn't compensate the soldiers
	- Soldiers got angry, revolted
	- Since the government couldn't collect tax, it couldn't set up an army to fight back
	- The people realized that the government needs revenue sources ASAP, before America find itself in an existential threat
